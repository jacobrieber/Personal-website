    <!-- Project Overview -->

    <div class="container-fluid projectOverview">
      <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center">
        <div class="col-lg-9">
          <p class="exampleCode">[The scene: Jacob’s sitting on his couch. The TV is immediately in front of him. It’s turned off and sitting on 2 dining room chairs. The laundry is folded and sorted, but it’s still on the dining room table. There
            are orange string lights turned on above the door to the balcony. They’re Halloween lights.] </p>

          <p>It’s currently 11:56AM, and it’s the first day of 2022. I wish I could say I got up at 6am, did some meditations, went to the gym, and made a brunch that would even make my girls Emily Mariko and Claire Saffitz jealous, but – the reality
            is – I woke up around 11am this morning, I still have a some major bead head, and my roommate is hungover in the room next door. 2022, we’re starting the year off right!! <br /><br />

            Now, I’m not someone who journals, and I would not be surprised if this is the only blurb I write all year. However, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on 2021 and put some intention behind 2022. Now, I’ll save you the reflection piece
            because I’ve done a lot of that internally in the ‘ole noggin, but I’ll give you the highlights. Essentially, 2021 was a great year in terms of living in a space that I’m proud of, starting a career, and being surrounded by a lot of love
            (shout out to my friends and family
            <3). It was a really comfortable and a great year! With that said, a lot of the year felt like I was just existing - just taking each day as it came and not really working towards anything in particular. Now, that’s a 100% fine way to
              live, but for me, it’s now started to feel uninspiring. <br /><br />

            So 2022, this one’s on you (and me . .. it’s on me too). I want this year to be about creativity, creation, learning, and doing interesting projects. <br /><br />

            In high school, I loved making things – whether that be creating a giant spider puppet from socks or designing sets for my high school one act competition. I ate that shit up. In college, however, I strayed away from that and became a
            real corporate man. I focused on school, joined consulting clubs, and became a very standard output from Penn. And you know what, I ate that shit up too. It was fun, but I want to bring more of the creation into my life. <br /><br />

            So, in the words of my the tiktoker @hal.baddie: <br /><br />

            <i>“Manifest. Manifest. Manifest. Shine. Shine. Shine. Love. Love. Love”</i> <br /><br />

          <h5>Bring in the goals for 2022:</h5>
          <dl class="">
            <dt>Learn:</dt>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn to code: current goal is to focus on learning coding languages for web development, but maybe I’ll learn some app stuff. Only time will tell, but right now the focus is on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
            <dt>Create:</dt>
            <ul>
              <li>Develop and publish a personal website: not fully sure what’s going to be on this, but I’ll post this journal(?) there for sure</li>
              <li>Design and create 2 other websites</li>
              <li>Digitize Jacob: I’ll admit – I’m not sure what this will be, but I think it’d be fun to actually make a concentrated effort on posting videos, blogs, or something</li>
            </ul>
            <dt>Misc:</dt>
            <ul>
              <li>Maybe study for the GMAT / GRE (Ew lol)?</li>
            </ul>
          </dl>
          <p>Ok, looking at this, some of these goals are pretty nebulous, and I’ve heard it’s best to make things as concrete as possible if you’d really like to achieve them. But ehh, I don’t know. I’ll brew on the specifics later.</p>
          <p class="exampleCode">[The Scene: Jacob’s still on the couch. He had a nosebleed in the middle of writing this, so there’s a bloody paper towel to his left. His roommate, Sharon, is wiping down the kitchen counters. She’s less hungover.]
